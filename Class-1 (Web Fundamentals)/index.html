      In databases, it is common to have tables that store different types of
      data. <b>Sometimes it becomes necessary to transform the row-level data into
      column-level data</b>. Pivot in MySQL is a type of query that involves
      transforming rows into columns. It is also known as a crosstab query or a
      transposed table. In a pivot query, the rows of the original table are
      turned into columns, and the columns of the original table become rows.
      This is useful when you want to summarize data in a table and display it
      in a different format. This can be achieved using the PIVOT() function,
      which is available in some database servers like Oracle or SQL Server.
      However, MySQL does not support this function. To achieve this in MySQL, a
      query can be used that makes use of the CASE statement within the SELECT
      clause to group and summarize the data. The resulting query would then
      display the rotated data, with the rows converted into columns.
